# High-level objectives

[List the key objectives for the iteration, typically one to five. Examples follow.]

# 3. Work Item assignments

[This section should reference **either** the Work Items List, which provides information about what Work Items are to be addressed in which iteration by whom, **or** specifically call out the Work Items Lists to address in this iteration. The preferred solution depends on whether or not it is trivial for team members to find the subset of all Work Items that are assigned to the iteration by using search methods, rather than the Iteration Plan.]

Please see the Work Items List for Work Items to be addressed in this iteration.
