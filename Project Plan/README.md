**Open Rent**

**Project Plan**

# Introduction

This plan consist of the entire project plan to construct all the Group work home of the discipline Software engineer proposed by Fernando Antonio De Araujo Chacon from computer Science Department of University of Brasília (UnB).

# Project organization

See also [https://github.com/flpinheiro/ProjetoES](https://github.com/flpinheiro/ProjetoES)

This work is divided into the following content areas:

Project Manager: Felipe Luís Pinheiro

Analyst: Wanderlan Alves de Jesus Brito

Architect: William Coelho da Silva

Tester: Andrey Calaça Resende

# Project practices and measurements

[Describe or reference which management and technical practices will be used in the project, such as iterative development, continuous integration, independent testing and list any changes or particular configuration to the project. Specify how you will track progress in each practice. As an example, for iterative development the team may decide to use iteration assessments and iteration burndown reports and collect metrics such as velocity (completed work item points/ iteration).

The OpenUP component team will use OpenUP practices adapted to address the fact that we are doing content development rather than coding. Key artifacts include: Project defined process, project plan, iteration plan, tools, glossary, vision, system-wide requirements, usa-case model, use case, architecture notebook, user interface project, database physical project, infrastructure, test cases.

Progress is tracked using two primary measurements using a point system. It is estimated that 1 point represents 2h of work:

- Project backlog: The project backlog shows progress relative to overall work to be done within the project.
- Iteration backlog: The iteration backlog shows progress relative to work intended for the current iteration.
