\section*{Project practices and measurements}

The OpenUP component team will use OpenUP practices adapted to address the fact that we are doing content development rather than coding. Key artifacts include: Project defined process, \gls{project plan}, \gls{iteration} plan, tools, glossary, vision, system-wide \gls{requirement}, usa-case model, use case,\gls{architecture} notebook, user interface  project, database physical project,\gls{infrastructure}, \gls{test case}.
Progress is tracked using two primary measurements using a point system. It is estimated that 1 point represents 2h of work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project \gls{backlog}: The project backlog shows progress relative to overall work to be done within the project.
	\item Iteration backlog: The iteration backlog shows progress relative to work intended for the current iteration.
\end{itemize}
